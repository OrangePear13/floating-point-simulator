# floating-point-simulator

This simulates addition and subtraction on IBM hexadecimal floating-point (HFP by IBM) numbers.

This project is for educational purposes and thus does not implement all features present in actual IBM HFP. Additionally present features are not necessarily implemented as efficiently as they feasibly could be. The goal is simply to achieve correct *output* for the implemented functions.
